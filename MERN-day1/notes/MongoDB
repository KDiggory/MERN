~~~~~~~~~~ MongoDB ~~~~~~~~~~

MySQL is a relational database - the data is stored in tables, these tables are relational to each other in some way --> primary and foreign keys!

MongoDB is a non-relational database - the data is not stored in tables, it doesn't have to be related to each other (it can be related if you need it to be). 

MongoDB works like a cloud storage provider
- Its a document store.
- Documents (objects) are stored within databases in the cluster. 
- Documents are stored as BSON (Binary JavaScript Notation).
{
    "name": "Monty",
    "species": "Iguadon"
    }
A BSON is just like a JSON! 
Uses Key Value Pairs for the data storage


A database - data related to a project
Within the database - collections --> stores of documents
Within collection - BSON objects

Collections SHOULD contain similar data but they do not NEED to
