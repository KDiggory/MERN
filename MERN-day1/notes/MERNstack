MERN stack

MERN            what            like what?

MongoDB      database             MySQL
NodeJS       backend source code   JAVA
Express       framework            Spring  
React        frontend               HTML

Pros:
- Less to learn as use JS for Node, Express and React ( BSON, Binary JS and Object notation for MongoDB).
- Easier generally for codebases to interact with eachother when using hte same programming language.

Cons:
- Less efficient, JS is a jack of all trades but master of none, can't handle as well enterprise level backend. 
- Doesn't work well with massive applications, mongoDB and react are fine with this, but NBodeJS and Express not so much. 
- Not taking advantage of positives of other codebases. --> don't use the correct programming language for the correct jon - MERN doesn't do this. 

Application:
- Generally used for smaller start up companies which require a working codebase.
