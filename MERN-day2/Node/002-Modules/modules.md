When using Node.js each JS file is a module
Modules are collections of JS kept separate to reduce coupling and increase cohesion.
Modules are separate so that if one file breaks, they don't all break and people can work on different files at the same time. 
Modules can be imported into other JS modules to access their code. 
This allows us to access files from other locations and utilise the code. 

Exercise
create 2 new JS file, one exports a string and the other imports it and uses it in a function to print it out. 

Stretch
create a js file called calculator with calculate functions and export them all
separate js file imports the functions and adds their own numbers, exports the sum
separate js file prints the value
