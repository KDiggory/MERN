#Node
Node provides a JS runtime separating JS from the client and using it for the server side.

Open a terminal in this current location (right click here > open in integrated terminal)

Type node and press enter -> 'Welcome to Node.js v16.13.1.'
When using node you're using a node bash shell ( you can know that because of the > symbol at the start of the line)
This means you can't use linux commands such as ls and cd!
You can write JS commands into the shell like you can when using the browser.

When you need to exit node (because we wont use it to write all our code), press ctrl+c or type.exit

You know you aren't in node anymore because the > is gone
