# React setup

React is isntalled through NPM/ NPX
React is a BIG project - dont create a separate project for each folder as takes 5-10 mins to install each time
`npx create-react-app <project name>`
name - no caps, no underscores and no spaces
npx - grabs and executable package and runs it

When installed, cd into the folder where it is my-app (the location of the package.json file)
type `npm start`
This opens a web browser on localhost:3000
